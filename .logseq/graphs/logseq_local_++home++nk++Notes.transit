Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years\n\t- producer:: Peter Norvig   \n\t  input:: [[articles]]\n\t  link:: https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html\n\t  tags:: interesting, development, tech-articles\n\t- > In 24 hours you won't have time to write several\n\t  significant programs, and learn from your successes and failures with\n\t  them.\n\t- > As Alexander Pope said,\n\t  a little learning is a dangerous thing.\n\t- > [Alan Perlis](http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html) once said: \"A language that doesn't affect the way you\n\t  think about programming, is not worth knowing\".\n\t- > Mozart, who was a musical prodigy at age 4, took\n\t  13 more years before he began to produce world-class music.\n\t- > Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) said \"Excellence in any department can be attained only by the labor of a lifetime; it is not to be purchased at\n\t  a lesser price.\"\n\t- > Chaucer (1340-1400) complained \"the lyf so short, the craft\n\t  so long to lerne.\"\n\t- > \" Hippocrates (c. 400BC) is known for the excerpt \"ars longa,\n\t  vita brevis\", which is part of the longer quotation \"Ars longa, vita\n\t  brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium\n\t  difficile\", which in English renders as \"Life is short, [the] craft\n\t  long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment\n\t  difficult.\"\n\t- > As \n\t  Prof. [K. Anders Ericsson](http://www.amazon.com/K.-Anders-Ericsson/e/B000APB8AQ/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1) puts it, \"In most domains it's remarkable how \n\t  much time even the most\n\t  talented individuals need in order to reach the highest levels of \n\t  performance. The 10,000 hour number just gives you a sense that we're \n\t  talking years of 10 to 20 hours a week which those who some people would\n\t   argue are the most innately talented individuals still need to get to \n\t  the highest level.\"\n\t- > **Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun.

Unlike Strings, Numbers do not need to have quotes.\n\t\t- Math.round()\n\t\t\t- method to round the number up. This method rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.\n\t\t- .toString()\n\t\t\t- turn a number into a string.\n\t\t- if statements \n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t  if (n > 1) {  \n\t\t       console.log('the variable n is greater than 1.')  \n\t\t     } else {  \n\t\t       console.log('the variable n is less than or equal to 1.')  \n\t\t  }\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- for loop \n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  \n\t\t       // log the numbers 0 through 9  \n\t\t       console.log(i)  \n\t\t  }\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- The first part, let i = 0, is run once at the beginning of the loop. The variable i is used to track how many times the loop has run.\n\t\t- The second part, i < 10, is checked at the beginning of every loop iteration before running the code inside the loop. If the statement is true, the code inside the loop is executed. If it is false, then the loop is complete. The statement i < 10; indicates that the loop will continue as long as i is less than 10.\n\t\t- The final part, i++, is executed at the end of every loop. This increases  \n\t\t  the variable i by 1 after each loop. Once i reaches 10, the loop will exit.\n\t\t- Arrays\n\t\t\t- An array is a list of values\n\t\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t\t  const pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'rat']\n\t\t\t  ```\n\t\t- .filter()\n\t\t\t- filtering arrays to only contain certain values.\n\t\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t\t  const pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant']  \n\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t     const filtered = pets.filter(function (pet) {  \n\t\t\t       return (pet !== 'elephant')  \n\t\t\t  })\n\t\t\t  ```\n\t\t- accessing arrays \n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t  const pet = ['cat', 'dog', 'hamster']\n\t\t  console.log(pets[0])  \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- Objects\n\t\t\t- Objects are lists of values similar to arrays, except values are identified by keys instead of integers.\n\t\t\t  ``` javascript  \n\t\t\t  const foodPreferences = {  \n\t\t\t     pizza: 'yum',  \n\t\t\t     salad: 'gross'  \n\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t  ```\n\t\t- You can access and manipulate object properties –– the keys and values that an object contains –– using a method very similar to arrays.\n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t  const example = {  \n\t\t       pizza: 'yummy'  \n\t\t     }         \n\t\t  console.log(example['pizza'])\n\t\t  // you can use dot notation to get identical results:  \n\t\t  console.log(example.pizza)\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- Here's an example of listing all object keys using the Object.keys() prototype method.  \n\t\t  ``` javascript \n\t\t   const car = {  \n\t\t     make: 'Toyota',  \n\t\t     model: 'Camry',  \n\t\t     year: 2020  \n\t\t   }  \n\t\t   const keys = Object.keys(car)       \n\t\t   console.log(keys)  \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- The above code will print an array of strings, where each string is a key in the car object. \n\t\t  ``` javascript \n\t\t  ['make', 'model', 'year']\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- function\n\t\t\t- A function is a block of code that takes input, processes that input, and then produces output.\n\t\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t\t  function example (x) {  \n\t\t\t       return x * 2  \n\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t  ```\n\t\t- We can call that function like this to get the number 10:  \n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t    example(5)  \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- Arguments can be from any type. An argument could be a string, a number, an array, an object and even another function.\n\t\t- scope\n\t\t\t- Scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.\n\t\t- JavaScript has two scopes: global and local. A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout your program. A variable that is declared inside a function definition is local. It is created and destroyed every time the function is executed, and it cannot be accessed by any code outside the function.\n\t\t- Functions defined inside other functions, known as nested functions, have access to their parent function's scope.\n- # JavaScript DOM \n    ___\n\t- When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.\n\t\t- What is the DOM\n\t\t\t- The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:\n\t\t\t\t- Core DOM - standard model for all document types\n\t\t\t\t- XML DOM - standard model for XML documents\n\t\t\t\t- HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents\n\t\t- What is HTML DOM\n\t\t\t- HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML.\n\t\t\t\t- The HTML elements as objects\n\t\t\t\t- The properties of all HTML elements\n\t\t\t\t- The methods to access all HTML elements\n\t\t\t\t- The events for all HTML elements\n\t- The DOM Programming Interface\n\t- In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as *objects*.\n\t- A *property* is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).\n\t- A *method* is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).\n\t  ```html\n\t  <html>\n\t  <body>\n\t  \n\t  <p id=\"demo\"></p>\n\t  \n\t  <script>\n\t  document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello World!\";\n\t  </script>\n\t  \n\t  </body>\n\t  </html>\n\t  ```\n\t- In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.\n\t- In the example above the getElementById method used id=\"demo\" to find the element.\n\t- The innerHTML property is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements.\n\t\t- Changing the Value of an Attribute\n\t\t  ``` javascript \n\t\t  document.getElementById(id).attribute = new Value\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- To change the value of an HTML attribute, use the above syntax \n\t\t  ```html \n\t\t  <!DOCTYPE html>\n\t\t  <html>\n\t\t  <body>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <img id=\"myImage\" src=\"smiley.gif\">\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <script>\n\t\t  document.getElementById(\"myImage\").src = \"landscape.jpg\";\n\t\t  </script>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  </body>\n\t\t  </html>\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- this changes the attribute of the src image\n\t\t\t- document.write()\n\t\t\t\t- In JavaScript, document.write() can be used to write directly to the HTML output stream\n\t\t- ## JavaScript HTML DOM events\n\t\t- Using events\n\t\t- The HTML DOM allows you to execute code when an event occurs.\n\t\t- Events are generated by the browser when \"things happen\" to HTML elements:\n\t\t- An element is clicked on\n\t\t- The page has loaded\n\t\t- Input fields are changed\n\t\t- Event Listeners\n\t\t- Add an event listener that fires when a user clicks a button\n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t  document.getElementById(\"myBtn\").addEventListener(\"click\", displayDate);\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- Reacting to events\n\t\t\t- A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.\n\t\t- To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:\n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t  onclick=JavaScript\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- changing the <h1> element on click \n\t\t  ``` javascript\n\t\t  <!DOCTYPE html>\n\t\t  <html>\n\t\t  <body>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <h1 onclick=\"changeText(this)\">Click on this text!</h1>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <script>\n\t\t  function changeText(id) {\n\t\t   id.innerHTML = \"Ooops!\";\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  </script>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  </body>\n\t\t    </html>\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- HTML Event Attributes\n\t\t  To assign events to HTML elements you can use event attributes.\n\t\t  ``` html \n\t\t  <!DOCTYPE html>\n\t\t  <html>\n\t\t  <body>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <h2>JavaScript HTML Events</h2>\n\t\t  <p>Click the button to display the date.</p>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <button onclick=\"displayDate()\">The time is?</button>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <script>\n\t\t  function displayDate() {\n\t\t   document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = Date();\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  </script>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  <p id=\"demo\"></p>\n\t\t  \n\t\t  </body>\n\t\t  </html> \n\t\t    ```\n\t\t- The onload and onunload Events\n\t\t- The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.\n\t\t- ## JavaScript HTML DOM - Changing CSS\n\t- The HTML DOM allows JavaScript to change the style of HTML elements.\n\t  ``` javascript  \n\t  document.getElementById(id).style.property = new style\n\t  ```\n\t-",536870919]],["^15",[358,"^17",1711008441247,536870919]],["^15",[358,"^Z","pages/JavaScript.md",536870919]],["^15",[359,"^K",1711008442662,536870919]],["^15",[359,"^[",358,536870919]],["^15",[359,"^@",false,536870919]],["^15",[359,"^Y","javascript",536870919]],["^15",[359,"^11","JavaScript",536870919]],["^15",[359,"^B",1711008442662,536870919]],["^15",[359,"^;","~u65fbeaba-a27b-4ea5-9031-1a0508562252",536870919]],["^15",[360,"^Q","The

dev, python, programming\n\n\t- Python is a very powerful high-level, dynamic object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.\n\t- Python is a programming language that also supports scripting, making it suitable for rapid application development.\n\t- Python currently has three implementations, known as <b>CPython  Jython and Iron-Python</b>\n\t\t- **CPython.** Classic Python (often just called Python) is the fastest, most up-to-date, and complete implementation of Python. It is\n\t\t  implemented in C.\n\t\t- **Jython.** Jython is a Python implementation that is Java Virtual\n\t\t  Machine (JVM) compliant. With Jython, we can use all Java libraries\n\t\t  and frameworks.\n\t\t- **IronPython.** IronPython is a Python implementation for the Microsoft designed Common Language Runtime (CLR), popularly known as .NET.\n\t- Features of Python\n\t\t- Python is easy to learn\n\t\t- It has easier to read syntax\n\t\t- it uses white spaces\n\t\t- python is free\n\t\t- It comes with a large number of libraries included\n\t\t- Python can be integrated with other languages\n\t\t- supports exception handling\n\t- **Expressions**\n\t\t- In Python, 2 + 2 is called an expression , which is the most basic kind of programming instruction in the language. Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value.\n\t\t- ![Screenshot_20231127_160207.png](../assets/Screenshot_20231127_160207_1701119042696_0.png)\n\t\t- The order of operations (also called precedence ) of Python math operators is similar to that of mathematics. The ** operator is evaluated first; the *,/, //, and % operators are evaluated next, from left to right; and the + and - operators are evaluated last (also from left to right).\n\t- **String Concatenation and Replication**\n\t\t- The meaning of an operator may change based on the data types of the values next to it. For example, + is the addition operator when it operates on two integers or floating-point values. However, when + is used on two string values, it joins the strings as the string concatenation operator.\n\t- **Variables**\n\t\t- where you can store a single value\n\t\t\t- **Variable Names**\n\t\t\t\t- 1. It can be only one word.\n\t\t\t\t- 2. It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.\n\t\t\t\t- 3.

tell you so*\n\t\t\t- third option which really is not an about but a hegel reply would be **Because she is the only woman willing to sleep with me**\n\t\t- thinking like this takes a lot of effort and is hard to learn to think that way\n- ## Use case ?\n\t- you will notice you have limitations and sometimes you can not go further while noticing that you have gaps in your knowledge\n\t- you can't think using first principle all the time , unless your being Freud and telling someone that the closet in their dream is a representation of their fathers genitalia meaning it is not for every

adding another paragraph command lets you indent.\n\t\t- two new line breaks creates another paragraph below\n\t\t- .NH section heading *automatically number*\n\t\t\t- .NH 2 subsection\n\t\t\t- > All macros have to be line inital\n\t\t- .B bold \n\t\t  ```troff \n\t\t  .PP \n\t\t  Normal paragraph this is \n\t\t  .B bold text \n\t\t  non bold text continues \n\t\t  ```\n\t- .I italic\n\t- .BI bold italic\n\t- .RS insert text here .RE all the text within will be indented more\n\t- .AB abstract\n\t- .TH Defines the title and header information for a document.\n\t- .SH Starts a new section within a document.\n\t- .SS Starts a new subsection within a section.\n\t- .P Starts a new paragraph.\n\t- .B Applies bold formatting to text.\n\t- .I Applies italic formatting to text.\n\t- .T Inserts a table.\n\t- .FIG Includes a figure or image in the document.\n\t- .EQ Starts an equation block.\n\t- .PS/.PE: Begins and ends a PostScript block.\n\t- .TP Creates a hanging paragraph with a tag and description.\n\t- .UL Applies underline formatting to text.\n\t- .NF/.FI Starts and ends a fixed-width font section.\n\t- .TH Defines the title and header information for a document.\n\t- .DT/.DD Used in a description list to define terms and descriptions.\n\t- ## Images\n\t\t- install `imagemagick` usually intalled by default\n\t\t\t- using the `convert` command convert the image to pdf `convert p.png p.pdf`\n\t\t- Photos in groff require a .PDFPIC register, which takes PDF photos. It can be used with the -C -R -L for left, right and center respectively.\n\t\t\t- .PDFPIC -[L|C|R] [Width[Height]] \"image_path.pdf\"\n\t\t- Post Script\n\t\t\t- same as pdf convert the image to post script\n\t\t\t- use .PSPIC -L|C|R width and height and \"path to image.eps\"\n\t- ## Tables\n\t\t- .TS table start , .TE to end\n\t\t- Table data is tab separated\n\t\t\t- but can be changed using the tab() operator\n\t\t- r - makes it right, l - left, n - for number based \n\t\t  ```troff \n\t\t  .TE \n\t\t  allbox tab(|);\n\t\t  c s s s  \n\t\t  c s c s \n\t\t  c c c c.\n\t\t  title \n\t\t  sub | sub \n\t\t  a a | a a \n\t\t  .TE \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- c means center, s means skip\n\t\t- to format long test in the table start the string with T{ start on a new line and close with T}\n\t\t- expand () can be used along side the allbox to expand the table to the marign space\n\t\t- if all box is not used you can get flexibile with where the lines are places for your box \n\t\t  ```troff \n\t\t  .TE \n\t\t  tab(|);\n\t\t  c s s s \n\t\t  c s |c s \n\t\t  c c |c c. \n\t\t  title \n\t\t  sub | sub \n\t\t  a a | a a\n\t\t  .TE \n\t\t  ```\n\t- ## Math\n\t- define disc `some equation` works like declaring a variable so you don't\n\t  have to rewrite an equation over and over again.\n\t\t- disc is the variable name\n\t- ## Table of Contents (TOC)\n\t\t- .XS start and .XE end and .XA\n\t\t- .TC for creating table of content \n\t\t  ```troff \n\t\t  .NH \n\t\t  heading \n\t\t  .XS\n\t\t  heading one \n\t\t  .XE\n\t\t  \n\t\t  .NH \n\t\t  heading 2 \n\t\t  .XS \n\t\t  heading two \n\t\t  .XE \n\t\t  \n\t\t  \n\t\t  .TC \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- another easier way is to add .XN before the heading it also adds pdf book marks automatically \n\t\t  ``` troff \n\t\t  .NH \n\t\t  .XN heading \n\t\t  \n\t\t  .bp \n\t\t  \n\t\t  .NH \n\t\t  .XN heading two \n\t\t  \n\t\t  .TC \n\t\t  ```\n\t- ## Colors\n\t\t- to define a new color do .defcolor veryred rgb 1 0 0, can also use hexvalue\n\t\t- .gcolor veryred to start definition of color and .gcolor to end it\n\t\t- .color 0 disables all colors and .color 1 enables\n\t\t- m[veryred] m[]  using colors inline\n\t- ## Compiling\n\t\t- normal groff to pdf \n\t\t  ``` bash  \n\t\t  groff -ms /file/path/ -T pdf  > outputfile.pdf \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- when there is pdf pic included \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  groff -Tpdf -U -ms /inputfile/.ms > output.pdf\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- when there is math included \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  groff -Tpdf -P-e -e -ms groff.ms > output.pdf\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- Convert to PostScript then to PDF \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  groff -Tps -KtespG -ms groff.ms \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- then \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  ps2pdf groff.ps > output.pdf \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- With Table of content \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  pdfroff groff.ms -mspdf > output.pdf \n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- with tables \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  tbl groff.ms | groff -ms -Tpdf \n\t\t  ```\n\t- ## Adding Fonts\n\t\t- using the install.sh script from {https://schaffter.ca/mom/}[mom]\n\t\t- create a directory\n\t\t- go into that directory\n\t\t- wget or curl your font \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  wget https://www.ams.org/arc/tex/amsfonts.zip\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- the script supports .ttf, .otf, .pfa, .pfb fonts\n\t\t- move all the fonts you want to install into a separate directory\n\t\t- also add the install script in that directory \n\t\t  ``` bash \n\t\t  sudo install-font.sh -s -F cm -f +R cmr12.pfb\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- after installing use the .FAM cm to use the newly installed latex font\n\t\t- to install variation of the font in bold and italics use +I and +B rather than +B\n- # Groff MOM\n- extension .mom\n\t- .PRINTSTYLE TYPESET: books and essay type font\n\t- .START: indicates begining of the document\n\t- .PP: paragraph

Awk and Grep \n  \n  * What Is sed?\n\t- sed was developed in 1971 at Bell Labs, by legendary computing pioneer Lee\n\t  E. McMahon.\n\t- The name stands for \"stream editor.\" sed allows you to edit bodies or\n\t  streams of text programmatically, through a compact and simple, yet\n\t  Turing-complete programming language.\n\t- The way sed works is simple: it reads text line-by-line into a buffer. For\n\t   each line, it'll perform the predefined instructions, where applicable.\n\t- The most basic sed script is \"Hello World.\" Here, we use the echo command,\n\t  which merely outputs strings, to print \"Hello World.\" But we pipe this to\n\t  sed, and tell it to replace \"World\" with \"Dave\". Self-explanatory stuff. \n\t  @code bash \n\t  echo \"Hello World\" | sed s/World/Dave/\n\t    @end\n\t\t- You can also combine sed instructions into files if you need to do some more complicated editing.\n\t\t- add all your wanted sed instructions into a file and add the extension *.sed* \n\t\t  @code bash \n\t\t  cat random.txt | sed -f greg.sed\n\t\t  @end\n\t\t- the -f flag tells it to open the script as a file\n\t\t- another example :\n\t\t  @code bash \n\t\t  sed -i 's/git/github/g' all.txt\n\t\t  @end\n\t\t- what the below command does is, it finds the line that starts with github\n\t\t- then it will search for the term ghp on the line github, and when it finds it.\n\t\t- it will replace everything that comes after ghp including ghp itself \n\t\t  @code bash \n\t\t  sed -i '/github/s/ghp.*/ghp_ghgj/' all.txt \n\t\t  @end\n\t\t- deleting match patterns \n\t\t  @code bash \n\t\t  sed \"/<matching pattern>/d\" <some file> \n\t\t  @end\n\t\t- matching the opposite(invert) pattern use the !  \n\t\t  @code bash \n\t\t  sed \"/<matching pattern>/!d\" <some file>\n\t\t  @end \n\t\t  \n\t\t  \n\t\t  * What Is AWK?\n\t- AWK, like sed, is a programming language that deals with large bodies of text.\n\t- But while people use sed to process and modify text, people mostly use AWK as a tool for analysis and reporting.\n\t- Like sed, AWK was first developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s.\n\t- ts name doesn't come from what the program does, but rather the surnames of each of the authors: \n\t  -- Alfred Aho \n\t  -- Peter Weinberger \n\t  -- Brian Kernighan.\n\t- AWK works by reading a text file or input stream one line at a time.\n\t- Each line is scanned to see if it matches a predefined pattern. If a match is found, an action is performed.\n\t- awk takes spaces as delimeters\n\t- to print all everything in a file we use \n\t   @code bash \n\t   awk '{print}' file.txt \n\t   @end\n\t- to print the first field\n\t   @code bash \n\t   awk '{print $1}' file.txt \n\t   @end",536870919]],["^15",[1058,"^17",1711008443238,536870919]],["^15",[1058,"^Z","pages/sed and awk.md",536870919]],["^15",[1059,"^Q","You can also combine sed instructions into files if you need to do some more complicated editing.",536870919]],["^15",[1059,"^O","^16",536870919]],["^15",[1059,"^F",1078,536870919]],["^15",[1059,"^X",822,536870919]],["^15",[1059,"^V",1078,536870919]],["^15",[1059,"^U",822,536870919]],["^15",[1059,"^;","~u65fbeabb-4809-4427-8d4b-b297f00929da",536870919]],["^15",[1060,"^Q","the -f flag tells it to open the script as a file",536870919]],["^15",[1060,"^O","^16",536870919]],["^15",[1060,"^F",1068,536870919]],["^15",[1060,"^X",822,536870919]],["^15",[1060,"^V",1078,536870919]],["^15",[1060,"^U",822,536870919]],["^15",[1060,"^;","~u65fbeabb-843f-4170-a2bc-391b8b25391c",536870919]],["^15",[1061,"^Q","The name stands for \"stream editor.\" sed allows you to edit bodies or\nstreams of text programmatically, through a compact and simple, yet\nTuring-complete programming language.",536870919]],["^15",[1061,"^O","^16",536870919]],["^15",[1061,"^F",1064,536870919]],["^15",[1061,"^X",822,536870919]],["^15",[1061,"^V",1080,536870919]],["^15",[1061,"^U",822,536870919]],["^15",[1061,"^;","~u65fbeabb-f384-4bab-a2b6-1a97f2c08594",536870919]],["^15",[1062,"^Q","deleting match patterns \n@code bash \nsed \"/<matching pattern>/d\" <some file> \n@end",536870919]],["^15",[1062,"^O","^16",536870919]],["^15",[1062,"^F",1081,536870919]],["^15",[1062,"^X",822,536870919]],["^15",[1062,"^V",1078,536870919]],["^15",[1062,"^U",822,536870919]],["^15",[1062,"^;","~u65fbeabb-deb3-41dc-9069-5ce55e0d77de",536870919]],["^15",[1063,"^Q","to print all everything in a file we use \n @code bash \n awk '{print}' file.txt \n @end",536870919]],["^15",[1063,"^O","^16",536870919]],["^15",[1063,"^F",1066,536870919]],["^15",[1063,"^X",822,536870919]],["^15",[1063,"^V",1080,536870919]],["^15",[1063,"^U",822,536870919]],["^15",[1063,"^;","~u65fbeabb-975c-4ff8-afd2-e43d503fb5e2",536870919]],["^15",[1064,"^Q","sed was developed in 1971 at Bell Labs, by legendary computing pioneer Lee\nE.
